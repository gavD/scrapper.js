                        <p><strong>What's difficult is <em>management of expectations</em>.</strong></p>

                        <p>Have you ever shown a manager a page where you've built the interface, and they've thought that you've built the whole system? They've assumed that validation, security, and all user journey are in place? Yes?</p>

                        <p>Well, <strong>it never need happen again!</strong></p>

                        <p>With Scrapper.js, it's really clear when an element isn't complete! All you need to do is put 'class="scrapper"' on an element and it will look like a scrap of paper rather than a slick element!</p>

                    <p>We've done a bit of work on this part of the page! It's basically doing what we want, but we don't feel happy with it yet. As professionals, we can't say it's finished.</p>

                    <p>In fact, the client hasn't fed back on it yet! <strong>How CAN such a thing be FINISHED?!</strong></p>

                    <p>Our unit test coverage on this feature is only 70%. We WERE using TDD, but then we introduced a new library and we got a bit behind. We're sorting it, honest!</p>

                    <p><strong>Even better!</strong></p>

                    <p>It has integration tests that satisfy ALL user journeys! The client's been involved since day 1, and this is DONE!</p.

                    <p>Yep, we sign off on this part of the page, for sure!</p>
